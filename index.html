        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Audrey Chew. I am 18 years old and I live in Glendora, California. I am a first year student at University of California, Riverside, and I am currently studying business. Outside of school, I like hanging out with my friends and family, listening to different kinds of music, and taking pictures. Spending time with my family and friends is something that is very important to me because time is very precious, so it is nice to have quality with my loved ones. Music is also something I really enjoy because it puts me in a good mood. If I am in a bad mood or sad, listening to any type of music instantly lifts me up. Especially when I have both of my earbuds in, I am able to listen to the lyrics and beats clearly and analyze the song. Listening to music is simply relaxing. I also like taking pictures especially on disposable cameras because I like how the pictures look like vintage pictures. Taking pictures is a creative outlet for me and allows me to express myself.  <br><br>

        A few of my hobbies are swimming and playing the cello. I learned how to swim when I was very young and started competitive swimming when I was in 6th grade. I ended my swim career my senior year of high school; although, I still take time to swim when I have a chance to. Swimming has taught me a lot. Physically it taught me ways to build up my stamina and strength, and mostly important how to learn how to do the four different strokes; but,  I also learned how to be a team player and a leader. Swimming is an individual sport, but every swimmer has their team that is there to support them. My sophomore year of swim I was chosen to be captain of the team and that helped me with my leadership skills. Along with the other two captains, we were able to lead the team and help the girls with any problems they had. My second hobby is playing the cello. I started playing when I was in 5th grade and stopped playing my senior year of high school. I currently do not have a cello, but I plan to buy a cello and start playing it again in the future. Playing an instrument has also taught me a few things like how to read music, but also how to appreciate classical music.   <br><br>

        I also like to travel. Every year I travel to Singapore to visit my family and to relax. Traveling is a very special experience because I am able to explore, learn about the different cultures and learn about my dad's life when he lived in Singapore. Personally, traveling is another one of my favorite things to do because it is an eye opening experience.
